The key difference between tuples and lists is that while the tuples are immutable objects, lists are mutable.
This means that tuples cannot be changed while lists can be modified.

List data are written in array brackets. ex []
a_list = [1,2,3,4,5]

Tuple data are in round brackets. ex ()
a_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
