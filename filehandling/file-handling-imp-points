Note: For most file reading and writing operations in Python, the 'with' statement is recommended.

Automatic resource management: The file is guaranteed to be closed when you exit the with block, even if an exception occurs during processing.
Cleaner and more concise code: You don't need to explicitly call close(), making your code more readable and less error-prone.
