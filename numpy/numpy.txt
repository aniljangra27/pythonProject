NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open source Python library that’s used in almost every field of science and engineering.
It’s the universal standard for working with numerical data in Python, and it’s at the core of the scientific Python and PyData ecosystems.
NumPy's users include everyone from beginning coders to experienced researchers doing state-of-the-art scientific and industrial research and development.
The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages.

What’s the difference between a Python list and a NumPy array?
NumPy gives you an enormous range of fast and efficient ways of creating arrays and manipulating numerical data inside them. While a Python list can contain different data types within a single list, all of the elements in a NumPy array should be homogeneous. The mathematical operations that are meant to be performed on arrays would be extremely inefficient if the arrays weren’t homogeneous.

Why use NumPy?
NumPy's arrays are faster and more compact than Python lists. An array consumes less memory and is convenient to use.
NumPy uses much less memory to store data, and it provides a mechanism of specifying the data types.
This allows the code to be optimized even further.


Numpy Array
numpy.array() – Creates array from given values.
numpy.zeros() – Creates array of zeros.
numpy.ones() – Creates array of ones.
numpy.empty() – Creates an empty array.
